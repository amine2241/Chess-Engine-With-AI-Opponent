# Chess Game

This is a chess game implemented using **Pygame**. The project includes three main interfaces:

- **Main Menu:** The user can choose to play locally, play against AI, or quit the game.
- **AI Difficulty:** The difficulty level for playing against AI can be set to **Easy**, **Normal**, or **Hard**.
- **Chess Game:** The main chess game interface where users can play a complete game.
